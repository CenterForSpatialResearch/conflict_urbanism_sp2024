**Background and Scope**

Our project delves into the urgent and critical theme of documenting cultural heritage in Ukrainian cities, focusing particularly on those that have been or are at risk of being affected by the ongoing conflict. The cities of Kyiv,  Lviv, Mariupol, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, and Odesa serve as primary case studies. These cities not only house Ukraineâ€™s rich monuments and sites but also have experienced the most severe damage. 

For the project, we lay out maps of various documentation and preservation efforts in relation to the map of destroyed sites. In addition, we discuss the power dynamic of the involved stakeholders, including local and international institutions and organizations.

**Argument**

The project touches upon the themes of memory, identity, resilience, and heritage. Collateral damage or deliberate targeting of cultural heritage sites is not only a loss of material artifacts; it also assaults the collective memory and identity of a people and culture. This project refers to the theories of strategic use of cultural destruction as a weapon of war. The ways local communities document and preserve cultural heritage also present the resilience of urban spaces and communities in conflict zones.
