#### **Introduction: Surveying the Forest**

In 1950, in line with the post-World War II technoscientific era, Brazil and the United States signed the Agreement for Special Technical Services. This agreement delineated a mutual commitment between the two nations to undertake cartographic projects in Brazil alongside a spectrum of technical cooperation initiatives. However, it wasn’t until 1964—following the civic-military coup that would trigger almost twenty years of U.S.-backed dictatorship in Brazil—that the first aerial survey operation began. The Inter-American Geodetic Survey (IAGS), a federal undertaking inaugurated during President Harry S. Truman's incumbency in 1946, was tasked with spearheading the project on behalf of the United States. 
The core objective of the Inter-American Geodetic Survey (IAGS) was to facilitate cartographic mapping across the Antilles, Central, and South Americas through cooperation. Their mission was "to make the countries cartographically self-sufficient" having the United States as the provider of training and technical support to local technicians and students in all phases of their mapping programs. In exchange for such support, the United States gained unfettered access to the acquired data, paving the way for the potential emergence of divergent interests and strategic maneuvering.

It is also important to highlight that the enlistment of scientists and technicians to collaborate with the military apparatus under the dictatorship constituted a strategy aimed at cultivating an aura of impartiality—using a rhetoric of objectivity, modernization, and efficiency—not only in the context of the nation's modernization but also concerning the legitimization of the regime itself. Thus, cartography emerged as a tool for social control and narrative construction.

As a direct consequence of this complex network, the "Radar in the Amazon" (RADAM) project emerged in the 1970s. This initiative aimed to employ side-looking airborne radar (SLAR) technology to map the entire Amazon Basin and assess its natural resources, thereby situating the region within the broader geopolitical framework. Aligned with the National Integration Program, which delineated the imperative of conducting surveys encompassing topography, forest cover, geomorphology for mineral exploration, energy resources, soil composition, drainage patterns, and territorial cohesion, the newfound radar technology was deployed by the military regime to penetrate the forest, enhancing the often inaccurate or incomplete understanding of the Amazonian terrain by non-indigenous people.
The extensive presence of clouds, attributed to the region's high atmospheric humidity and distinct meteorological dynamics, made conventional aerial photography coverage—an approach employed since 1964—impractical for conducting surveys in the Amazon. In a collaborative effort between the Brazilian National Commission for Spatial Activities and NASA, it became clear that radar technology was the best way to survey the North of Brazil and overcome the weather conditions.

In 1975, the project changed its name to RADAMBRASIL as it expanded to encompass the entirety of the national territory. During this same year, the initiative disclosed data regarding gold, cassiterite, and uranium deposits in the Amazon region, which drew thousands of men to participate in what would later be recognized as the Brazilian "gold rush" of the twentieth century. One of the stages of this migratory and economic process occurred in Roraima, on the border with Venezuela, in an area occupied by the Yanomami people, the largest indigenous group in the country. The area constituted Sheet NA/NB.20 within RADAM.
