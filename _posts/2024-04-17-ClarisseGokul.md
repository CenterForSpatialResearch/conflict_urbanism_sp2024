#### **Introduction**

The majority of the gold traded in Brazil today shows signs of illegality, affecting mainly the territories of the Kayapó, Munduruku, and Yanomami peoples in the Amazon region. According to a report released by INTERPOL in April 2022, illegal gold mining not only devastates the environment—causing water, air, and soil pollution, as well as deforestation—but also contributes to phenomena related to forced population displacements, corruption, organized crime, and human rights violations.
