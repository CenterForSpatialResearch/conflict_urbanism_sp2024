#### - Abstract 

Throughout the Vietnam War, the United States dropped as many as 260 million cluster bombs on Laos, equivalent to a bombing mission every eight minutes for nine years. By the end of the war, approximately 80 million bombs remained undetonated. It has been threatening the lives and property of the Lao people for 50 years. Laos is a country whose economy is heavily dependent on agriculture, and the buried bombs have seriously hampered the country's agricultural development. Therefore, since 1996, Laos has worked with global assistance to clear these remnants of war, with 78% of the cleared land repurposed for agriculture between 1997 and 2022. 

Worth noting is - financial resources, technical support, and government policies are solely directed toward bomb clearance projects in Laos, leading to insufficient investment and support in post-clearance endeavors. With limited resources allocated to rehabilitating cleared (or possibly incompletely cleared) farmland, agricultural restoration largely relies on farmers independently. This research delves into the ongoing challenges and barriers between cluster bomb clearance and cropland revitalization, highlighting the need for increased international support to bridge this critical gap.

Write **words in bold** like this.  

Italics are *similar* and are formatted like this.  

To make a paragraph break you need to add two spaces at the end of your line before going to the next line.  

See this is now a new paragraph.  

Lists are easy:
1. they can be ordered
1. like this
1. notice that the numbers are automatically ordered
  1. use two spaces in front to indent

Or they can just be bullet points:
- like this
* or like this
  - use two spaces
  - to have nested lists

Use Author-Date parenthetical citations following Chicago Manual of Style conventions throughout your document, and add a works cited at the bottom of your post. See Author-Date quick guide [here](https://www-chicagomanualofstyle-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-2.html) for citation conventions.  

To include hyperlinks format them like this [text of link](http://c4sr.columbia.edu/).  

To embed images first ensure that the file is at least 740px wide. Then place the image file in a folder named for your group in the images folder. Then link to that image using the format here, but replace the file path with the name of your group's folder and appropriate image file name:  

![description of image](/conflict_urbanism_sp2024/images/sample_image.png)

If you want to include html files (i.e. an interactive map) host these via your personal github page, and then you can embed them in your document with a iframe. The format looks like this:  

<div class="iframe-column"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/290575503?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>  


All you need to do to use one is replace the url that is between the two " ". Here is an iframe of mapbox tiles:  

<div class="iframe-column"><iframe src="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/mapbox/satellite-v9.html?title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibWFwYm94IiwiYSI6ImNpejY4NDg1bDA1cjYzM280NHJ5NzlvNDMifQ.d6e-nNyBDtmQCVwVNivz7A#2/0/0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
