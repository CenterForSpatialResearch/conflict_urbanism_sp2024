#### **Introduction**   

The quest to ensure the safety of our streets is a multifaceted endeavor that transcends mere infrastructural and political efforts. It is a complex challenge that weaves social, economic, design, and public health dimensions together. This case study explores the sophisticated dynamics of urban mobility, focusing on how different modes of transportation interact within city environments and the implications for safety and governance. It critically evaluates the efficacy of interventions in environments where private interests might eclipse public governance and the collective needs of communities.  

Over the past four months, our collaboration with the Legal Aid Society has been pivotal in addressing significant traffic management issues. Together, we have supported advocacy for sentence mitigation for their clients through innovative methods. Our contribution has produced visual data narratives that enhance their video mitigation projects, which aim for various judicial outcomes, including reduced sentences, case dismissals for justice, and advocating for release on recognizance rather than bail.  

Our work has specifically focused on the critical intersection of Meeker Avenue and McGuinness Boulevard in Brooklyn. Through animated clips and illustrations, we have highlighted the shortcomings in street design at this location. These visual representations underscore the urgent need for improved traffic safety measures to foster a safer urban environment for all.  


#### **The Legal Aid Society** 

The Legal Aid Society, a nonprofit organization in the U.S., provides complimentary legal services to individuals and families with limited financial resources who need help to afford legal counsel. Founded in 1876, the organization maintains several offices across the nation, concentrating primarily on the needs of New York City's residents. The scope of their services encompasses legal representation in civil, criminal, and juvenile rights cases, as well as advocacy for structural changes that enhance fairness and justice within the legal system. In the last four months, we have engaged with the Legal Aid Society on one of their active cases about traffic management. Our contributions involve working together to develop visual representations highlighting street design concerns, focusing on crafting empathetic narratives for the focused case about their incarcerated client. It is crucial to mention that the data used in creating these representations is confidential and will be anonymized in our report.  


#### **Thematic Concerns**

At the heart of our study lies the recognition that traffic accidents and collisions are not solely the result of individual actions. Understanding that inadequate road design creates hazardous conditions for all street users is crucial. This thematic argument is supported by foundational concepts from "The Safe Systems Pyramid: A New Framework for Traffic Safety" by Ederer et al., 2023, and the principles underpinning New York City's Vision Zero initiative.  

Ederer and colleagues advocate for viewing road safety through a systemic lens, arguing that road accidents are typically the result of complex interactions between agents, hosts, and environmental conditions rather than just individual errors (Ederer et al., 2023). Their research critiques traditional safety frameworks that overly emphasize behavioral interventions and mistakenly place the burden of responsibility on individuals within the road environment. This perspective aligns with the public health approach that underpins Vision Zero, which contends that traffic-related deaths and severe injuries are preventable and that no loss of life on the roads is acceptable.  

Since its implementation in 2014, New York City's Vision Zero has aimed to eliminate traffic fatalities through comprehensive strategies, including engineering improvements, traffic law enforcement, and public education. The city's efforts have led to some of the safest years on record, yet the initiative's success hinges on continual innovation and rigorous evaluation.  

This approach gains particular relevance in the focal intersection of Meeker Avenue and McGuinness Boulevard—an area historically neglected regarding safety enhancements despite being recognized as one of the borough's most dangerous. A proposed redesign of McGuinness Boulevard, which included protected bike lanes aimed at improving safety for micro-mobility users, was initially supported but ultimately abandoned due to opposition, as noted by Mayor Eric Adams' aide, Ingrid Lewis-Martin. This decision, which contradicted previous approvals and grassroots advocacy for the redesign, has drawn criticism and raised concerns about the commitment to future safety improvements in the area.  

By examining these dynamics, our research aims to illuminate how existing street conditions and systemic failures in implementing safety measures exacerbate the circumstances. This thematic exploration underscores the need for a holistic approach to road safety that transcends individual blame and focuses on systemic changes to prevent such tragedies. This approach is not just a theoretical proposition but a practical necessity, as outlined in the cited works and the ongoing debates around Vision Zero's implementation and challenges.  

Furthermore, we have crafted narratives illuminating the social and urban challenges the Legal Aid Society's clients face. We aim to bolster the Society’s mission of delivering justice and legal representation to underprivileged and economically disadvantaged groups, especially by highlighting mitigating circumstances in their legal proceedings. Our contributions are designed to make a tangible impact on the video mitigation cases for clients. We also aspire for our outward-facing initiatives to foster wider conversations about restorative justice and to promote movements toward the abolition of prisons.  

#### **Methods**  

The intersection analysis methodology incorporates a mixed-methods approach of three key components: historical analysis, streetscape mapping, and 3D model reconstruction.  

Historical Analysis: This initial phase focuses on reviewing past incidents and collisions at the location and any efforts historically made to enhance safety in the area. We gathered insights into recurring problems and identified opportunities for improvement, providing a contextual foundation for the subsequent stages of analysis.  

Streetscape Mapping: The second component involves creating a comprehensive map of the site and its immediate environment. This detailed mapping pinpoints critical street elements such as road markings, sidewalks, and the sites of previous accidents. This visual documentation is crucial for understanding the spatial and environmental factors contributing to the site's safety issues.  

3D Model Reconstruction: The final element of our methodology utilizes 3D modeling to bring a three-dimensional perspective to the analysis. This reconstruction includes critical features such as elevation changes, traffic signal locations, and nearby structures. By simulating the physical context of the street and collision sites, this model highlights systemic design flaws that increase the risk and frequency of accidents. The model also recreates scenarios leading up to collisions, including placeholders for pedestrians and vehicles. Lastly, walkthroughs or fly-through simulations illuminate the site's critical details and environmental conditions.  


#### **Case**
The focal point of this case is a hazardous intersection of Meeker Avenue and McGuinness Boulevard in Brooklyn. It lacks crucial safety features for the protection of pedestrians and motorists. Notable issues at this site include an absence of marked pedestrian crossings, inadequate street lighting that diminishes visibility during nighttime hours, and traffic signals that need to be better positioned on an overhead flyover, making them difficult for drivers to see. Additionally, the design of the parking access under the bridge is fraught with hazards, lacking distinct signals and clear signage. This intersection also suffers from poorly timed traffic lights, which do not allow enough time for safe pedestrian crossings. Despite installing bollards intended to protect designated bike lanes, the absence of proper lane markings and intersection-specific safety measures has led to severe, sometimes fatal, accidents. This case underscores the pressing need for a comprehensive overhaul of safety protocols at this intersection to enhance urban traffic safety effectively.  


#### **Takeaways**  
- Advocacy and Legal Support through Legal Aid Society: Collaboration with the Legal Aid Society has underscored the importance of supporting legal advocacy for traffic-related issues. Our contributions include creating visual narratives that effectively argue for judicial leniency, demonstrating society's role in bridging justice and public safety.  

- A Systemic View on Traffic Safety: Traffic incidents must be recognized as outcomes of systemic issues, not individual errors. The case illustrates the need for a public health approach, advocating for policy reforms and comprehensive urban planning to enhance road safety.  

- Continuous Improvement in Safety Initiatives: Vision Zero's aim to eliminate traffic fatalities highlights the necessity of ongoing innovation and community involvement to overcome challenges in implementing safety measures, particularly in complex urban settings like the Meeker Avenue and McGuinness Boulevard intersection.  

- Urgent Need for Strategic Safety Overhauls: Investigations into intersection safety reveal dire needs for comprehensive improvements. Our findings support the need for integrated safety measures to safeguard all road users.  

- Privacy and Data Integrity in Legal Cases: Handling sensitive data with the utmost confidentiality is crucial, particularly when publicizing geospatial information. Ensuring that all shared data preserves the anonymity and security of the individuals involved is paramount.  

- Accuracy and Completeness of Case Data: The complexity of the cases managed by the Legal Aid Society requires that all utilized data be current and thorough to support case narratives and legal strategies accurately.  

- Collaborative Communication with Diverse Professionals: Effective partnerships with various professionals demand clear communication and mutual understanding to ensure that all project outputs are practical, accessible, and meet the varied needs of all project stakeholders.
