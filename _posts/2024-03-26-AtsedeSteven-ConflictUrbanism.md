*I sat in the living room of my  aunt’s home looking out to a perfect view of Meskel Square, a central artery  for gathering in today’s Addis Ababa. Her apartment was what some would consider, “prime real estate”, situated atop the square on perhaps one of the only roads people call by name, Bole Road. Though the building looked like it hadn’t been cared for in decades. Sitting there, watching, listening,  my uncle, who has never traveled outside of Ethiopia, was complaining to my father about an old man in his neighborhood who spends his free time picking up trash discarded in the street and around monuments…”are you mad about that? You should be thanking him, paying him, in fact joining him”...”why doesn’t he just mind his business?”* (Recorded memory, Atsede Assayehgen, June 2023)

Pride within Ethiopian people, collectively, is a precarious thing.

#### ****Methodology**** 

This project has utilized a wide-ranging intersection of research and data methods. Such methods include first-person research, practice of oral history, analysis of satellite imagery, archival map sourcing and tracing, and georeferencing. The methods have been stitched together to attempt to paint a detailed picture of the cultural, political, and spatial impact of landmarks in Addis Ababa.

Though we acknowledge that the picture we paint is not complete, not without bias, and has not been without challenges. We experienced limitations to access in our archival material research, limitations to overall data publicly available and maintained by academic and national agency sources, temporal and quality gaps in aerial imagery, and difficulties with georeferences.

These challenges necessitated that we pursue a more flexible approach to data collection and analysis, requiring us to triangulate information from multiple sources or to adapt our methods as new data becomes available. Despite these limitations, our methods have already yielded some insights into the urban and cultural evolution of Addis Ababa, reflecting both its colonial past and its modern development trajectories.
