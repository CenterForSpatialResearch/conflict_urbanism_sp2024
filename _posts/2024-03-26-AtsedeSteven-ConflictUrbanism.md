*I sat in the living room of my  aunt’s home looking out to a perfect view of Meskel Square, a central artery  for gathering in today’s Addis Ababa. Her apartment was what some would consider, “prime real estate”, situated atop the square on perhaps one of the only roads people call by name, Bole Road. Though the building looked like it hadn’t been cared for in decades. Sitting there, watching, listening,  my uncle, who has never traveled outside of Ethiopia, was complaining to my father about an old man in his neighborhood who spends his free time picking up trash discarded in the street and around monuments…”are you mad about that? You should be thanking him, paying him, in fact joining him”...”why doesn’t he just mind his business?”* (Recorded memory, Atsede Assayehgen, June 2023)

Pride in Ethiopian culture, considered on a collective scale, is a precarious thing. It’s propped up by the narrative of being the only country in Africa that has never been colonized - a narrative that is factually untrue but socially undisputed.

We conducted research on 34 notable landmarks between the two neighborhoods, tracing their contemporary histories, architectural influences, and financing intersections. The clustering of landmarks around and between Africa Hall and the African Union Conference Center loosely follows the pattern of palace-centered axial development that characterized Addis Ababa’s urban growth up until the the fall of the last empire (Tufa 2008). The pattern has been blurred by informal development which upticks in times of conflict.

To support the platform and color the story of landmark development, on-the-ground experience, and care we developed an image repository. The repository includes additional landmarks constructed along modernist design principles and those that emerged from the so-called new style Ethiopian modernism. Though such new modernism can be categorized as confused (Zeleke 2010). It is our hope that the repository (currently private) feeds into ongoing research.


##### *Methodology*

This project utilized an intersectional array of research methods and data analysis tools. Such methods included first-person research, oral history, analysis of satellite imagery, archival image and map sourcing, and GIS analysis such as through georeferencing. These methods have been stitched together to attempt to paint a detailed picture of the landmark-ification of Addis Ababa as a tool of foreign influence.

Though we acknowledge that the picture is not complete, not without bias, and has not been without challenges. We experienced limitations to archival material access, available data, and available aerial imagery. Political volatility since 1975 has halted consistency with institutional data collection, and a lack of stable technology and power in Addis Ababa have stunted archiving and data collection advancements. Further, as students of  spatial-based practices we recognize a practice-wide inclination to objectify the environment around us and transfigure spaces to become fascinating. Such bias emulates a top-down perspective we’ve been critical of in this work.

Throughout the research we questioned the neutrality of archival images and maps of mid-20th century Ethiopia that exist, in majority, through the lens of Italian governmental agencies, Italian expatriates, or American governmental agencies. Thus lacing historical documentation, and holding hostage the historization of growth and progress with colonial biases. Which we, and many Ethiopian nationals engaged in overlapping research, have had no choice but to integrate. These challenges necessitated a flexible and holistic approach to data collection and analysis, and personally implicating ourselves within the work.


***How does one  navigate a city using landmarks when the landmarks themselves are confused?***

That question remains and keeps this research open to being part of a much larger project. Landmarks offered this research a lens on historical consistencies. Despite stark shifts in regimes and sociopolitical ideologies there has been a reliable focus on the image making of Addis Ababa and the Ethiopian people; so much so that it has overshadowed, and in turn disoriented the attachment one makes to a place. It’s not really about the landmark, about the grandeur of a building, or about the architect. The continuing research is about politicizing the culture of space and how one either grasps onto or reforms identity in the midst of spatial, cultural, and political tumult. As is the environment in Ethiopia today.
