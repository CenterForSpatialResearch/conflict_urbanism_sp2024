title:  "'Benign' Development: Asia Foreign Developers in Asia"

#### Introduction  

While the impacts of foreign investment by Western developers in Asian countries are often studied and critiqued, less attention is given to the impacts of development in Asian countries by foreign Asian developers, or â€˜Asia-to-Asia development'. This project aims to examine the motivations and impacts of Asia-to-Asia development. Local governments tend to perceive foreign Asian developers to have better regional knowledge and contextualized economic growth strategies that they are able to replicate in their own cities. As compared to Western developers, these Asia-to-Asia development practices are thought to be benign. This study aims to investigate if they are true to what they are purported to be. 

The projects in discussion center on the involvement of significant foreign direct investment and foreign developers on projects such as industrial parks, special economic zones, new city developments, and tech parks that range from 29-17,000 hectares in size. By analyzing four case studies in four countries, each with different land use types and scales, we seek to understand the temporal land use changes and impacts of Asia-to-Asia development on local urban residents and the surrounding land.
