#### Introduction


Water scarcity and its management in today’s time has become central to understanding the balance and future of urbanization, rural development and water- particularly in regions heavily reliant on agriculture. The conflict over groundwater in Kansas can be immediately related to the "hydraulic society" thesis (Wittfogel, 1957), where control over water resources is the crux on which power dynamics, social relations, and economic activities revolve. Wittfogel's theory, often referred to as "hydraulic civilization" theory, says that societies developing in arid regions will naturally evolve complex administrative and governance structures to manage water resources effectively. This theory emphasizes the central role of water control in societal development and the potential for conflict over water resources as a fundamental aspect of societal power dynamics. 



#### *The Story of the largest Aquifer in the United States of America*


An aquifer is an underground layer of permeable or “leaky” rock. The mixture of sediment and rock in these layers contains many holes of different sizes that are able to store a massive amount of water. The Ogallala Aquifer is one of the world’s largest fresh groundwater resources. It underlies 175,000 square miles in eight states. Starting as hundreds of feet of silt, clay, and gravel eroded from the Rocky Mountains and laid down by streams millions of years ago, rainfall during this time produced an underground lake. 

The Aquifer ies beneath portions of, including Texas, New Mexico, Kansas, Oklahoma, Colorado, Nebraska, Wyoming and South Dakota. The Ogallala has been the source of substantial, large-scale irrigation development, beginning in the 1950s, when affordable technology became available for extracting groundwater and applying it to large fields of cotton, corn, winter wheat, and sorghum.


#### *Why Kansas?*


![AquiferKansas](/conflict_urbanism_sp2024/images/AquiferKansas/KansasMap.gif)


Kansans rely on ground water for 85% of their water needs, including municipal, industrial, agricultural, and rural domestic water supplies. In fact, Kansas relies on ground water to supply a higher percentage of its water needs than almost any other state in the U.S. Eastern and western Kansas differ dramatically in their reliance on ground water. In the western two-thirds of the state, where precipitation amounts are usually small, relatively abundant ground-water due to the Ogallala Aquifer provides most of the water. 


#### *Agriculture in Kansas*


Agriculture has been a significant part of Kansas' economy since it was settled by European Americans in the mid-19th century. The Homestead Act of 1862 encouraged this settlement by offering land for farming. Over the decades, agricultural practices evolved with technological advancements in farming equipment and methods, significantly boosting the state's agricultural output. Agriculture contributes significantly to Kansas's GDP, making water usage a critical economic issue. Agriculture directly contributes billions to Kansas's Gross State Product (GSP). According to the Kansas Department of Agriculture, the agriculture and food sector contributes about **$67.5 billion** annually to the Kansas economy and supports over **247,000 jobs**.

#### *Water Wells and the Aquifer*

Water wells tapping into the Ogallala Aquifer are for agricultural irrigation, which accounts for around 85% of the water use from the aquifer in the state. They are often deeper and have a higher capacity to pump large volumes of water to support extensive agricultural activities. The ability to irrigate has allowed Kansas farmers to achieve higher yields and grow crops more consistently, even during periods of low rainfall.Over the decades, intensive water extraction for irrigation has led to substantial declines in water levels in parts of the aquifer. Some areas have experienced drops of over **150 feet**.

**The High Plains Aquifer is depleting at a rate that current practices cannot sustain. The aquifer regains a mere half an inch per year currently. Current predictions state that if the depletion rate remains constant the Aquifer will be completely diminished in the next 50-75 years**





#### *Water Depletion*


Water depletion is a measure of the fraction of available renewable water consumptively used by human activities within a watershed. Calculations from WaterGAP3 (Brauman, KD et al, 2016) was used to assess long-term average annual consumed fraction of renewably available water, then integrates seasonal depletion and dry-year depletion, also based on WaterGAP3 calculations, with average annual depletion. There are 8 water depletion categories: <5% depleted, 5-25% depleted, 25-50% depleted, 50-75% depleted, dry-year depleted, seasonally depleted, 75-100% depleted, and >100% depleted.

#### Please use level 4 headings for major section divisions  
(make sure to put two spaces after the end of the heading)

Write **words in bold** like this.  

Italics are *similar* and are formatted like this.  

To make a paragraph break you need to add two spaces at the end of your line before going to the next line.  

See this is now a new paragraph.  

Lists are easy:
1. they can be ordered
1. like this
1. notice that the numbers are automatically ordered
  1. use two spaces in front to indent

Or they can just be bullet points:
- like this
* or like this
  - use two spaces
  - to have nested lists

Use Author-Date parenthetical citations following Chicago Manual of Style conventions throughout your document, and add a works cited at the bottom of your post. See Author-Date quick guide [here](https://www-chicagomanualofstyle-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-2.html) for citation conventions.  

To include hyperlinks format them like this [text of link](http://c4sr.columbia.edu/).  

To embed images first ensure that the file is at least 740px wide. Then place the image file in a folder named for your group in the images folder. Then link to that image using the format here, but replace the file path with the name of your group's folder and appropriate image file name:

If you want to include html files (i.e. an interactive map) host these via your personal github page, and then you can embed them in your document with a iframe. The format looks like this:  

<div class="iframe-column"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/290575503?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>  


All you need to do to use one is replace the url that is between the two " ". Here is an iframe of mapbox tiles:  

<div class="iframe-column"><iframe src="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/mapbox/satellite-v9.html?title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibWFwYm94IiwiYSI6ImNpejY4NDg1bDA1cjYzM280NHJ5NzlvNDMifQ.d6e-nNyBDtmQCVwVNivz7A#2/0/0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
